# Hater

Hater is an opinionated starting point for building games with
[LÖVE](https://love2d.org). It was born out of my experience in competing in
competitions like [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) and my old LÖVE
skeleton, [Hatred](https://github.com/jarednorman/hatred).

## Getting Started

In the long run, I'd like to rewrite this as generator style thing, currently
you just clone this repo, and find and replace "hater" with your project's name
in all the places.
